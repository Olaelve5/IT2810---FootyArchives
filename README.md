### Aria labels
Aria labels are used to support screen readers
### Keyboard accesibility
We've made sure that users can use Footy Archives with a keyboard alone.

## Sustainability ü•¨

### Caching
We've utilized Apollo Clients's in-memory cache to store results of GraphQL queries locally. This reduces the need for repeated network request, which makes the website both faster and reduces the energy consumption from data transfers and server processing.

### Paging
We've used paging to make sure that only small parts of our large dataset is loaded at a time. This minimizes memory usage loading time and server usage, making Footy Archives more sustainable and easier to scale.

### Lightmode/Darkmode
The Lightmode/Darkmode option not only enhances the user experience, it also saves energy, with dark mode in particulary saving energy on OLED and AMOLED screens.

### Debounce
To optimize our search function, we've used debouncing to delay the execution of the search query until the user has stopped typing. This reduces unnecessary requests, which reduces server load.

## Responsivness
Footy Archives is fully resposnive and will work for both desktop and mobile users. For the mobile version, we modified our sidebar and navbar by merging them together and displaying it as a hamburger menu, this saved us space without loosing any functionality.
